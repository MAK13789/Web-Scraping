find a better way to split this so that it always starst from the beginning of the text and ends at the end of the text 


(for example, finding where the title or date is)


for now, just split it at some arbritrary indices that should work for most articles


maybe remove capitals


write it so that it scrapes google news or sth


so the type of the article would be given, and it would determine the most used words for that article


append that into a database


in the end you can see if there's a relation between most used words and type of article, and if so, use ML
